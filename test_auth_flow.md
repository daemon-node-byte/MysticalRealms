# Authentication Flow Test

## Problem

Dashboard and profile pages were stuck on infinite spinner.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Loading State Race Condition**: In `useAuth` hook, the loading state was only being set to `false` for the "latest fetch" due to fetchId check in `onAuthStateChange`
2. **Profile Loading Logic**: Pages had logic like `if (user && !profile)` that could cause redirects during the loading phase before profile was fully loaded

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed useAuth Hook Loading State

**File**: `/apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`

**Change**: Modified the auth state change listener to always set loading to false when auth state changes, not just for latest fetch:

```typescript
// Before: Only for latest fetch
if (currentFetchId === fetchId && isMounted) {
  setLoading(false);
}

// After: Always set loading state
if (isMounted) {
  setLoading(false);
}
```

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Loading Logic

**File**: `/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Change**: Only redirect when we're certain profile is null (not just loading):

```typescript
// Before: Could redirect during loading
if (user && !profile) {
  window.location.href = "/profile/setup";
  return null;
}

// After: Only redirect when loading is complete
if (user && profile === null && !loading) {
  console.log("Redirecting to profile setup: user exists but no profile");
  window.location.href = "/profile/setup";
  return null;
}
```

### 3. Fixed Profile Page Loading Logic

**File**: `/apps/web/src/app/profile/page.tsx`

**Change**: Applied same fix as dashboard page to prevent premature redirects.

### 4. Improved Profile Setup Logic

**File**: `/apps/web/src/app/profile/setup/page.tsx`

**Change**: Better handling of profile completion check and loading states.

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Dashboard**: Should load properly without infinite spinner
2. **Profile**: Should load properly without infinite spinner
3. **Authentication Flow**: Should work smoothly with proper loading states
4. **Profile Completion**: Should redirect to setup only when needed

## Test Plan

1. Navigate to `/signin` and sign in with: `jrmclain85@gmail.com`
2. Should be redirected to dashboard
3. Dashboard should show profile completion banner (profile is incomplete)
4. Click "Complete Profile" to go to setup
5. Fill out profile and save
6. Should return to dashboard with completed profile
7. Navigate to `/profile` page directly - should load without spinner

## Database State

- User exists: `jrmclain85@gmail.com`
- Profile exists but incomplete (username, bio, status are empty)
- Supabase local instance running on port 54321
